This initiative focuses on modernizing and standardizing GCP architecture to align with cloud best practices.
Key improvements include streamlined project structure, role-based access control, and centralized logging/monitoring.
Network design is enhanced with Shared VPCs, firewall policies, and VPC Service Controls for secure segmentation.
Security posture is strengthened through SCC, Binary Authorization, and workload identity federation.
Automation using Terraform ensures consistent, scalable, and compliant infrastructure provisioning.
Cloud Security Command Center (SCC),


Disorganized Project Hierarchy – Lack of documented structure leads to billing inefficiencies and poor access management.

Inconsistent Identity Management – No centralized control or Azure AD federation increases security risk.

Privilege Misuse – Without user audits, excessive permissions may go undetected.

Uncontrolled Network Access – Missing firewall rule validation could expose workloads to threats.

Limited Observability – Logs not integrated with Splunk and alerts not configured can delay incident response.



****

Fragmented GCP project structure increases complexity in managing workloads and impedes effective disaster recovery implementation.

Elevated security risks due to inconsistent IAM policies and lack of centralized identity federation with Azure AD.

Manual and resource-heavy operations for access reviews, identity management, and policy enforcement, leading to limited visibility and siloed alerting.

Greater audit and compliance burdens stemming from inconsistent logging, monitoring, and lack of policy standardization.

Higher GCP spend due to inefficient resource allocation, lack of automation, and missed opportunities for committed use discounts.

Reduced agility and innovation due to non-standardized environments, making scaling and new service adoption more difficult.
